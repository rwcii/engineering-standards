# Product Decision Records — Process Guide

Rules for creating, updating, and referencing PDRs in `docs/product/pdr/`.

---

## What is a PDR?

A PDR documents a **significant product, UX, or behavioral decision** along with its
context, alternatives, and consequences. PDRs help:

- Understand why the product behaves the way it does
- Separate product rationale from architectural rationale
- Preserve the "why" behind user flows, interaction patterns, and feature behavior

### PDRs vs ADRs

PDRs and ADRs use the same template but answer different questions:

| Dimension     | ADR                                          | PDR                                              |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Question**  | How is the system built?                     | How does the product behave?                     |
| **Scope**     | Structure, boundaries, patterns, policies     | User flows, feature behavior, UX contracts        |
| **Stability** | Changes when architecture changes            | Changes when product requirements change          |

**Rule of thumb:** if the decision survives a complete product pivot (new features, new
flows) it's an ADR. If it survives a complete rewrite (new language, new framework) it's
a PDR. The two often pair up: an ADR decides the mechanism, a PDR decides the behavior.

### When to Write a PDR

- **Defines user-facing behavior** that isn't obvious from the code
- **Affects multiple surfaces or features** — a behavior that spans several screens or flows
- **Involves genuine product alternatives with different trade-offs**
- **Captures flow design, state progression, or interaction contracts** — the steps,
  their order, their rationale

### When NOT to Write a PDR

- **Architecture or infrastructure decisions** — those are ADRs.
- **Bug fixes** — a misaligned button or wrong status code is an issue.
- **Implementation details** — which component to use, how to structure state.
- **Decisions fully captured in design tools** — don't duplicate the source of truth for
  visual design; PDRs capture behavioral rationale that design files don't.

### What PDRs Must NOT Contain

- **Line numbers or line counts** — reference file paths, symbol names, or record numbers.
- **AI/bot attribution** — no AI identifier in authors, body, commits, or anywhere.
- **Volatile implementation details** — cite user-facing behavior and product concepts,
  not code snapshots.

## Naming Convention

```
NNN-title-in-kebab-case.md
```

- Zero-padded sequential number prefix; kebab-case suffix, 3–6 words.
- Determine the next number from the `README.md` index; increment by one.

## Status Lifecycle

```
draft → under_review → accepted → modified
                                     ↓
                              deprecated / superseded
```

| Status         | Meaning                                                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `draft`        | A product insight or preliminary decision; not yet reviewed.          |
| `under_review` | Submitted for formal peer review.                                    |
| `accepted`     | Approved and in effect.                                              |
| `modified`     | An accepted PDR updated with new or amended decisions.               |
| `deprecated`   | No longer relevant (feature retired, flow removed).                  |
| `superseded`   | Replaced by a newer PDR (reference the replacement).                |

## PDR Template

structure:

```markdown

## Creating, Updating, Referencing

**Create:** pick the next number from the index → copy `000-template.md` → fill all
required frontmatter and sections → add a row to `README.md` → commit
`docs(pdr): add NNN [title]`.

**Update an accepted PDR:** change `accepted` → `modified`, bump `updated:`, add a
Document History entry, update the index, commit `docs(pdr): update NNN [title]`.

| Change Type                            | Action                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Typo, clarification, formatting        | Update in place (keep `accepted`)         |
| New decision added to existing context | Update in place (change to `modified`)    |
| Fundamental change to a prior decision | Create new PDR; set old to `superseded`   |
| Decision no longer relevant            | Set `status: deprecated` with explanation |

**Reference** from code with a short comment, from docs with a link, and to the
underpinning architecture via `related_adrs` in frontmatter.
